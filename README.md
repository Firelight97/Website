# Website
This is to help me understand how to make websites. Through the lessons in Codecademy.
If you have any ideas on what could help make it look better or any way to help improve it, please notify me in the https://www.https://github.com/Firelight97/Website/issues
Thank you for helping out and this means a lot for a newbie designer.

This site will mostly be about me and who I am as a gamer named Firelight7118. Commits will be with small changes each time. For now.
